# Image-Captioning-and-Segmentation
This project integrates Image Segmentation using a U-Net based model on Pascal VOC 2012 and Image Captioning using CNN+LSTM trained on Flickr8k. It demonstrates a combined vision pipeline that extracts objects at pixel level and generates human-like captions for images, showcasing end-to-end multi modal AI.
